# Start time of a process

The pid and the start time pair serves as the identifier of the process,
as process ids might be reused, but the chance of starting two processes
with identical ids within the resolution of the timer is minimal.

## Usage

``` r
ps_create_time(p = ps_handle())
```

## Arguments

- p:

  Process handle.

## Value

`POSIXct` object, start time, in GMT.

## Details

This function works even if the process has already finished.
