# List of child processes (process objects) of the process. Note that this typically requires enumerating all processes on the system, so it is a costly operation.

List of child processes (process objects) of the process. Note that this
typically requires enumerating all processes on the system, so it is a
costly operation.

## Usage

ps_children(p = ps_handle(), recursive = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- p:

  Process handle.

- recursive:

  Whether to include the children of the children, etc.

## Value

List of `ps_handle` objects.
